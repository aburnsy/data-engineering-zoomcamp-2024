```sql
df = df.withColumn('trip_time', F.round((F.col("dropOff_datetime").cast("long") - F.col("pickup_datetime").cast("long"))/3600,2))
q4 = df.select(F.max(df.trip_time)).show()
q4
```



## Question 5 Sparkâ€™s User Interface which shows the application's dashboard runs on which local port?

```python
location = spark.read.csv("taxi_zone_lookup.csv", header=True, inferSchema=True)
df.createOrReplaceTempView ('trips_data')
location.createOrReplaceTempView ('location')

q6 = spark.sql("""
    SELECT 
        Zone,
        count(*)
    FROM trips_data 
    JOIN location ON trips_data.PUlocationID = location.LocationID
    GROUP BY Zone
    ORDER BY count(*) ASC
""")
q6.show()

```
